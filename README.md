# Human-benchmark-bot
I made this bot just to practice python, i also used youtube tutorials, the special about it is that i added a realistic movement to the bot.

# Instructions:
 - Install the packages
    mouseinfo
    mouse
    pythonautogui
    pygetwindow
    pymsgbox
    pyrect
    numpy
    opencv

   - Run the code(Human benchmark website should be open)
   - you can also run it without opening the code with a text editor, just left click on the file and it will open with CMD.

  You can also use it with a different website you just need to apply your changes on the code and the grid.PNG.
